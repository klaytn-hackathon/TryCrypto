# SmartPage by TryCrypto


## Hackathon Submissions

**Smart Contracts:** We have three smart contracts. `recipe-seed` is a smart contract template for building recipes. `recipe-tipjar` is a simple recipe that we use to demonstrate the SmartPage platform. `recipe-workflow` is a work-in-progress and demonstrates a robust, business workflow recipe. 

Repositories: [recipe-seed](https://github.com/trycrypto/recipe-seed), [recipe-tipjar](https://github.com/trycrypto/recipe-tipjar) and [recipe-workflow](https://github.com/trycrypto/recipe-workflow)

`recipe-tipjar` is deployed to Baobab [here](https://baobab.klaytnscope.com/account/0xa97AFDDcace8FF6DE157bc52b24B8B16CD5E05c4)
